# metodo-bisezione
 A simple Python project for estimating solutions for equations.

## The Why
We started studying Limits in 5th year (italian high school) and came across this method for estimating solutions for some functions that we are not able to solve in simple ways.

## The How
We are going to 
- Ask for the function / equation
- Ask for an range to search a solution
- Perform a recursive calculation to verify the existence of the solution
